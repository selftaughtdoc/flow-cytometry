# flow-cytometry
cell sorting protocol 

## Description
This project includes the code and instructions for the immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis. It involves using a primary antibody against iCas9 (mouse) and a secondary antibody, which is conjugated with a fluorophore that doesn't overlap with the emission spectra of both APC and Fixable Violet Dead.
